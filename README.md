# Decision-Making Game Using ANN

This repository contains code for a project that explores the use of neural networks for decision making in games. The project implements a supervised learning algorithm using backpropagation to train the neural network. The code includes a neural network layer class and a neural network class that can be used as a starting point for implementation or modified to suit specific needs. The repository also includes test data to validate the implementation.

The objective of the project is to demonstrate the potential of neural networks in decision making for games, and provide a platform for experimenting with different neural network architectures.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Clone the repository to your local machine:

```git clone https://github.com/eridon/Decision-Making-Game-ANN.git```

## Implementation

The provided training data is used to train the neural network using the implemented supervised learning algorithm with backpropagation. The repository includes a neural network layer class and a neural network class, but you are free to modify or build your own classes as needed.

## Testing

The test data includes several scenarios for the game and the expected outcome, which can be used to validate the accuracy of the neural network's decisions. To test the implementation, use the following test data:

| Friends | Hit points | Enemy engaged | Range | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|--------------|-------|----------|
| 0       | 0.7       | 0            | 0.4   | ?        |
| 0.4     | 0.3       | 0            | 0.5   | ?        |
| 0       | 0.4       | 1            | 0.4   | ?        |
